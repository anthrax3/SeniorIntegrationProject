        This application is designed to test the relative security of different web frameworks. It supports four
        different frameworks.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>C#: ASP.NET MVC</li>
        <li>Ruby: Ruby on Rails</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All four applications reference the same MySQL 5.7 database. That database stores mock login and credit card information.
        Attacks that can be tested in this application include SQL injection and Cross-site scripting attacks. There is also a
        switch for high and low security. High security sets the backend code to be designed based on security recommendations made
        by the provider of the selected framework. Low security sets the backend code to be poorly designed compared to the provided
        security standards.
